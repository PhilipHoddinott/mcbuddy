##Main Functionality

As a McGill student, I want to arrange meetings with other classmates so I can study with them.

As a registered user, I want to be able to search for my friends on the site so I can use McBuddy's features to set up study groups with people I already know. [Potential story flow: automatically matching with facebook friends]

As a registered user, I want to be able to filter out potential study buddies based on preferred traits so I can more easily find study buddies I feel comfortable with.

As a registered user, I want a convenient way to communicate with the study buddies I get matched with, so I can explore with them opportunities to study together.

As a registered user, I want to be able to create, manage, or join a study group so I can use McBuddy to set up group study sessions.

##Platforms

As a smartphone user, I want to receive notifications to my device when I am matched with new potential study buddies, so I can conveniently follow up with them.

As a user operating a less common platform, I want there to be a platform-agnostic option to access the application, so I am not left out.

##User Profiles

As a prospective user, I want to fill up and periodically update my profile so I can advertise myself as a potential study buddy to other students.

As a registered user, I want to be able to review a potential study buddy's profile for information about him.

As a registered user, I want to be able to safely log out because I don't want someone to use my computer when I'm gone and pretend to be me.

As a user who is unhappy with the app, I want to be able to delete or otherwise make unavailable my user profile, so that I stop coming up in searches for study buddies.

As a user who forgot my password, I want to be able to recover access to my account somehow so I can continue using the application without losing all my past information.

##Class Schedules

As a registered user, I want to be able to automatically sync up my class schedule with other students so we can easily find times when we are both available.

As a registered user, I want to have a choice on whether I get matched with a particular user or not, so I can control who I get matched with.

As a registered user, I want to stop receiving study buddy requests for a specific class because I already have a study group. [alternate flow: re-enable that class because study group fell apart]

As a registered user, I want to access information pages for my classes so I can quickly reference that information when I need it.

##User Feedback

As a registered user, I want to be able to give feedback to the developers to express how I feel about the app.

##Community Management

As a registered user, I want to be able to report inappropriate messages and activities to the admin so I can feel like the app's community is safe.

As an admin, I want to be able to be able to effectively manage harassment, spam and other inappropriate behavior in the community so that users can feel safe.

As an admin, I want to see statistics on the McBuddy users so I can make business decisions about the product.
